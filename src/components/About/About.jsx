            Established in 1978, under the original name â€˜Madogs', our
            family-owned venue marks the very beginning of Edinburgh's cocktail
            culture. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Over the years our bar has become something of a Scottish
            institution and has welcomed both royalty and renowned artists from
            the likes of Princess Anne to 'The Temptations'. 
            <br/ >
            <br />
            Now passed from
            father to son, today, we proudly bear the name 'Elio's' in loving
            memory of the man who brought warmth to every pour.
